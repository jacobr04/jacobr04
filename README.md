Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m Jacob, a Data Scientist & Statistician who loves building things.

I develop games and small VR projects in Unity, and if an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is python, java, sql, tableau, and microsoft excel. I also enjoy using tools like Figma and Goodnotes on my iPad.

Fun Facts:
- I have two ducks
- I like ice coffee or green tea
- Hobbies: anime, gym, building things
